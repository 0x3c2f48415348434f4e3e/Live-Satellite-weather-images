# Satellite
Satellites carry vast amout of information

# What is the MetOP-A
This is a European satellite, and it is a polar orbiter. It orbits at a low
altitude, and the images provided are detialed information about the cloud
structure.

# Tools to intercept data
Although there are already tools out there, what i will do is build a satellite
ground station from scratch. So the tools needed according to my research includes:
1. Antenna
2. 
# what is a baofeng

# Frequency
Frequency most often measured in hertz is the number of occurences of a repeating
event per unit of time.

# Antenna Frequency

# What is frequency range

# What is gain in antenna

# What is polarization

# instruments within a satellite
A satellite may consist of:
1. Radiometers
2. Spectrometers
3. Interferometers

# What are radiometers
(TAKEN FOR GOOGLE)
An instrument used to provide image in elation to a satellite. Now a radiometere
in general is a device used for measuring the radiant flux (power) of
electromagnetic radiation. These instruments are particulat designed to detect or 
measure infrared radiation or ultraviolet

# What is radiant flux
(FROM WIKIPEDIA)
In radiometry, radiant flux or radiant power is the radiant energy emitted,
reflected, transmitted ot received per unit time and spectral flux or spectral
power is the radiant flux per unit frequency or wavelength, depending on whether
the spectrum is taken as a function of frequenct or of wavelength

# What is radiant energy
This is the enery of electromagnetic and gravational radiation
